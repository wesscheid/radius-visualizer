# Radius Visualizer - Project Status & Roadmap

## 🧠 Learnings & Actions

*   **Structural Refactoring (2026-01-15):** Consolidated the project from a nested `web/` directory to the root level. All configuration files (`package.json`, `tailwind.config.js`, etc.) and the `google-cloud-sdk` are now in the root.
*   **Documentation Initialization:** Created a comprehensive documentation suite in `./docs/`.
*   **Data Persistence (2026-01-16):** Implemented Firebase Anonymous Authentication and Firestore synchronization. Data now persists across sessions without requiring a formal login.
*   **Geolocation:** Added "Zoom to Current Location" functionality using the browser's Geolocation API.
*   **Production Deployment:** Successfully deployed to Vercel with automatic CI/CD from the `main` branch.
*   **Hybrid Range & Overlap Visualization (2026-04-11):** Implemented true annulus rendering (hollow center) and a geometric "Agreement Zone" polygon that highlights the exact area where all ranges in a group overlap. Added a "Focus" toggle to declutter the map by hiding the larger circles while keeping the overlap and markers visible.

## 🗺 Implementation Details

### State & Persistence
We use **Zustand** for local state and **Firestore** for persistence.
- **AuthGuard:** Automatically signs users in anonymously.
- **Real-time Sync:** `onSnapshot` in `AuthGuard` keeps the Zustand store in sync with Firestore.
- **Optimistic Updates:** Store actions update Firestore, and the listener handles the state refresh.

### Map Interaction
- **Leaflet Integration:** Switched from Google Maps to Leaflet/OpenStreetMap for better flexibility and cost-effectiveness.
- **Zoom to Location:** Uses `navigator.geolocation` to set the `mapCenter` in the store.

## 📝 Roadmap & Next Steps

1.  **Units Toggle:** Add ability to switch between Miles and Kilometers.
2.  **Account Upgrading:** Allow anonymous users to link a Google account to keep their data permanently across devices.
3.  **Export:** Add KML/CSV export for GIS compatibility.

## 💻 Development Guide

### Prerequisites
*   Node.js (LTS recommended)
*   Firebase Project (configured in `src/firebase.ts`)

### Running the Web App
1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

### Deployment
The project is connected to Vercel. Pushing to `main` triggers a production build.
To manually deploy:
```bash
npx vercel --prod
```
